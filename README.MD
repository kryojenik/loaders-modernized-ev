# [Loaders Modernized](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/loaders-modernized)

A Space Aged, compact loader the size of a single tile.  These loaders should be relatively UPS friendly
and do not use LUA script to move items.  They also do not use hidden inserters to move inventory.  However, they
do use power.  So keep those power poles handy!

## Belt mod [Extended Vanilla: Modular Logistics & Robotics](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/ev-logistics)

This mod adds support to Loaders Modernized to create loader tiers for Extended Vanilla.
